\title{Makes training and testing spatial folds}
\usage{
make_spatial_folds(
  xy.selected = NULL,
  xy = NULL,
  distance.step = NULL,
  training.fraction = 0.6,
  n.cores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy.selected}{Data frame with at least three columns: "x" (longitude), "y" (latitude), and "id" (integer, id of the record). Usually a subset of \code{xy}. Usually the result of applying \code{\link[=thinning]{thinning()}} or \code{\link[=thinning_til_n]{thinning_til_n()}} to 'xy' Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{xy}{data frame with at least three columns: "x" (longitude), "y" (latitude), and "id" (integer, index of the record). Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{distance.step}{Numeric, distance step used during the thinning iterations. If \code{NULL}, the one percent of the maximum distance among points in \code{xy} is used. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{training.fraction}{numeric, fraction of the data to be included in the growing buffer as training data, Default: 0.6}

\item{n.cores}{number of cores to use to generate spatial folds in parallel. Default: \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list with as many slots as rows are in \code{xy.selected}. Each slot has two slots named \code{training} and \code{testing}, with the former having the indices of the training records selected from xy, and the latter having the indices of the testing records.
}
\description{
Applies \code{\link[=make_spatial_fold]{make_spatial_fold()}} to every record in a data frame \code{xy.selected} to generate as many spatially independent folds over the dataset \code{xy} as rows are in \code{xy.selected}.
