# Changelog

## Version 1.1.5

CRAN release: 2025-12-19

- Fixed Windows-specific error in
  [`get_response_curves()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/get_response_curves.md),
  [`plot_response_curves()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/plot_response_curves.md),
  [`rf_evaluate()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_evaluate.md),
  and [`rf()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf.md)
  where [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html) method
  dispatch failed to find `predict.ranger()`. Added
  `@importFrom ranger ranger` to ensure ranger’s namespace is loaded and
  S3 methods are properly registered.

- Code quality improvements: fixed 129 linting issues identified by jarl
  linter, including inefficient vector logic operators in if statements
  (`|` → `||`, `&` → `&&`), redundant equality comparisons (`== TRUE` →
  direct boolean), and corrected two bugs in
  [`on.exit()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/on.exit.html) calls that weren’t
  properly restoring user options.

- Fixed error
  `Error in validate_prop(value, prop, check_fun, check_values, reset_na) : check_fun(value) is not TRUE`
  generated by `huxtable::set_all_borders(TRUE)`.

- Fixed warning “Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in
  ggplot2 3.4.0. ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.” produced by outdated
  calls to
  [`geom_line()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_path.html).

- Fixed issue with deprecated argument `draw_quantiles` of
  [`geom_violin()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html).

- Replaced deprecated calls to
  [`ggplot2::aes_string()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_.html)
  with
  [`ggplot2::aes()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html)
  plus `.data[[whatever]]`.

- Fixed parallelization issues with zombi processess across functions.

- Added internal helper function
  [`setup_parallel_execution()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/setup_parallel_execution.md)
  to centralize and improve parallel backend management across all
  functions. Now properly detects and respects user-configured backends
  (via `future`, `doParallel`, etc.) while maintaining support for
  external and internal cluster objects.

- Refactored cluster setup code across all parallelized functions
  ([`rf_spatial()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_spatial.md),
  [`rf_evaluate()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_evaluate.md),
  [`rf_tuning()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_tuning.md),
  [`rf_repeat()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_repeat.md),
  [`rf_compare()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_compare.md),
  [`rf_importance()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_importance.md),
  [`the_feature_engineer()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/the_feature_engineer.md),
  [`select_spatial_predictors_sequential()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/select_spatial_predictors_sequential.md),
  [`select_spatial_predictors_recursive()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/select_spatial_predictors_recursive.md))
  to use the new helper, improving consistency and reducing code
  duplication.

- Removed `if(interactive()){}` wrappers from function examples to
  ensure examples run during R CMD check.

- Function
  [`rf_spatial()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_spatial.md)
  now fits a spatial model even when that’s not necessary.

- Simplified
  [`auto_cor()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/auto_cor.md)
  and
  [`auto_vif()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/auto_vif.md)
  with unified sequential evaluation algorithm that better preserves
  user preference order.

## Version 1.1.4 (19/08/2022)

CRAN release: 2022-08-19

Re-submission, fixes CRAN checks arising from invalid links.

## Version 1.1.3 (22/9/2021)

CRAN release: 2021-09-23

Added the function
[`rf_importance()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_importance.md).
It fits models with and without each predictor, compares them via
spatial cross validation with
[`rf_evaluate()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_evaluate.md),
and returns the increase/decrease in performance when a given variable
is included in the model.

The default random seed for all functions have changed from `NULL` to
`1` to facilitate reproducibility.

The function
[`rf_evaluate()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_evaluate.md)
has a new argument named `grow.testing.folds`. When set to `TRUE`, it
uses `1 - training.fraction` instead of `training.fraction` to grow the
spatial folds, and then flips the names of the training and testing
folds. As a result, the testing folds are generally surrounded by the
training folds (just the opposite of the default behavior of the
function), which might be beneficial for particular spatial structures
of the training data. Thanks to **Aleksandra Kulawska** for the
suggestion!

## Version 1.1.2 (1/7/2021)

Overhaul of the methods used for parallelization. The functions
[`rf_spatial()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_spatial.md),
[`rf_repeat()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_repeat.md),
[`rf_evaluate()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_evaluate.md),
[`rf_tuning()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_tuning.md),
[`rf_compare()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf_compare.md),
and `rf_interactions()` can now accept a cluster definition generated
with
[`parallel::makeCluster()`](https://rdrr.io/r/parallel/makeCluster.html)
via the `cluster` argument. Also, models resulting from these functions
and [`rf()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf.md)
carry the cluster definition with themselves in the slot
`model$cluster`, so the cluster definition can be passed from function
to function using a pipe, as shown below:

    library(spatialRF)
    library(magrittr)

    #loading the example data
    data(plant_richness_df)
    data("distance_matrix")
    xy <- plant_richness_df[, c("x", "y")]
    dependent.variable.name <- "richness_species_vascular"
    predictor.variable.names <- colnames(plant_richness_df)[5:21]


    #creating cluster
    my.cluster <- parallel::makeCluster(
      4,
      type = "PSOCK"
    )

    #registering cluster (rf functions register it anyway)
    doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl = cluster)

      #fitting model
      m <- rf(
        data = plant_richness_df,
        dependent.variable.name = dependent.variable.name,
        predictor.variable.names = predictor.variable.names,
        distance.matrix = distance_matrix,
        xy = xy,
        cluster = my.cluster
      ) %>%
      rf_spatial() %>%
      rf_tuning() %>%
      rf_evaluate() %>%
      rf_repeat()

    #stopping cluster
    parallel::stopCluster(cl = my.cluster)

The system works as follows: If `cluster` is not `NULL` and `model` is
provided, the function looks into the model. If there is a cluster
definition there, it is used to parallelize computations, but the
cluster is not stopped within the function. If there is not a cluster in
`model`, then the function falls back to the argument `n.cores` to
generate a cluster that is stopped when the function ends its
operations.

These changes should improve performance when working with several
functions in the same script, becuase these functions do not have to
waste time in generating their own clusters.

The function `rf_interactions()` is now named
[`the_feature_engineer()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/the_feature_engineer.md).

The function `cluster_definition()` is now named
[`beowulf_cluster()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/beowulf_cluster.md),
and returns a cluster instead of a cluster definition to be used as
input for
[`parallel::makeCluster()`](https://rdrr.io/r/parallel/makeCluster.html).

## Version 1.1.1 (11/5/2021)

rf_repeat() now generates a proper “importance” slot for models fitted
with rf_spatial(), and preserves the “evaluation” and “tuning” slots if
they exist.

Simplified rf_spatial() by removing options to generate an rf_repeat()
model on the fly. rf_repeat() should only be used now at the end of a
workflow, as described in the documentation.

Fixed issue with the area of the violin plots generated by
plot_importance().

Improved the function rf_interactions() with a new type of interaction
(first factor of a PCA between two predictors), added criteria to reduce
multicollinearity among interactions, and between interactions and
predictors, and now the function returns data helpful to fit models
right away.

## Version 1.1.0 (6/5/2021)

Added new residuals diagnostics with the functions
residuals_diagnostics() and plot_residuals_diagnostics(). This changed
the name of the slot “spatial.autocorrelation.residuals” to “residuals”,
that now stores all the information relative to the residuals.

All plotting functions now allow to change the color of their key
components.

## Version 1.0.9 (20/4/2021)

Changed the names of function arguments from ‘x’ to ‘model’ or
‘distance.matrix’ for consistency. This might break code written
previously, but I hope argument names are more self-explanatory now.

The function rf_spatial() now fits a non-spatial model first, and only
generates spatial predictors for these distance.thresholds that show
positive spatial autocorrelation.

## Version 1.0.8 (16/4/2021)

Added a new function named filter_spatial_predictors(), that removes
redundant spatial predictors within rf_spatial(). It shouldn’t lead to
changes in the spatial models fitted with previous versions, but it will
make them more parsimonious.

Changed the style of the package’s boxplots.

When using rf_repeat(), the median of the variable importance scores,
performance scores, and Moran’s I is reported, instead of the mean.

## Version 1.0.7 (9/3/2021)

Added the functions plot_training_data() and plot_moran_training_data()
to help explore the training data prior to modeling.

Also fixed an issue where response variables could be identified as
binary by mistake.

## Version 1.0.6 (9/3/2021)

A bug regarding the predictions generated by
[`rf()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf.md) that
affected every other function fitting models has been fixed. Previously,
the model predictions came from the “predictions” slot produced by
`ranger()`. Such predictions are produced from the out-of-bag data
during model training, and are different and lead to lower R squared
values than those produced with predict(). Now the predictions yielded
by rf() are generated with predict(), and therefore you might notice
that now models fitted with spatialRF functions perform better than
before, because they do.

The function
[`print_evaluation()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/print_evaluation.md)
does not use huxtable any longer to print the evaluation results, and
only shows the results of the testing model.

## Version 1.0.5 (6/3/2021)

Added support for binary data (0 and 1). The function
[`rf()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/rf.md) now
tests if the data is binary, and if so, it populates the `case.weights`
argument of `ranger` with the new function
[`case_weights()`](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/reference/case_weights.md)
to minimize the side effects of unbalanced data.

## Version 1.0.4 (2/3/2021)

Fixed an issue where rf() applied the wrong is.numeric check to the
response variable and the predictors that caused issues with tibbles.

## Version 1.0.3 (25/2/2021)

Removed the function scale_robust() from rf(), and replaced it with
scale(). It was giving more troubles than benefits.

## Version 1.0.2 (24/2/2021)

Simplified rf_spatial().

Modified rf_tuning() to better tune models fitted with rf_spatial().

Minor fixes in several other functions.

## Version 1.0.1 (22/2/2021)

All ‘sf’ dependencies removed from the package.

## Version 1.0.0 is ready!
