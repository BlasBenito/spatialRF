\title{Moran's I test on a numeric vector for different neighborhoods}
\usage{
moran_multithreshold(
  x = NULL,
  distance.matrix = NULL,
  distance.thresholds = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector, generally model residuals, Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{distance.matrix}{Distance matrix among cases in \code{x}. The number of rows of this matrix must be equal to the length of \code{x}. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{distance.thresholds}{Numeric vector, distances below each value in the distance matrix are set to 0 (on separated copies of the distance matrix) for the computation of Moran's I. If \code{NULL}, it defaults to seq(0, max(distance.matrix), length.out = 4). Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, plots Moran's I values for each distance threshold. Default: \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
a named list with the slots:
\itemize{
\item \code{df}: Data frame with the results of \link{moran} per distance threshold.
\item \code{plot}: A plot of Moran's I across distance thresholds.
\item \code{max.moran}: Maximum value of Moran's I across thresholds.
\item \code{max.moran.distance.threshold}: Distance threshold with the maximum Moran's I value.
}
}
\description{
Applies \code{\link[=moran]{moran()}} to different distance thresholds at the same time.
}
\details{
The idea behind this function comes from the uncertainty about what "neighborhood" means in ecological systems (1000km in geological time means little, but 100m might be quite a long distance for a tree to disperse seeds over), and allows to explore spatial autocorrelation of model residuals for several minimum-distance criteria at once.
