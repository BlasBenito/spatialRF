## Version 1.0.9 (20/4/2021)

Changed the names of function arguments from 'x' to 'model' or 'distance.matrix' for consistency. This might break code written previously, but I hope argument names are more self-explanatory now.

The function rf_spatial() now fits a non-spatial model first, and only generates spatial predictors for these distance.thresholds that show positive spatial autocorrelation.

## Version 1.0.8 (16/4/2021)

Added a new function named filter_spatial_predictors(), that removes redundant spatial predictors within rf_spatial(). It shouldn't lead to changes in the spatial models fitted with previous versions, but it will make them more parsimonious.

Changed the style of the package's boxplots.

When using rf_repeat(), the median of the variable importance scores, performance scores, and Moran's I is reported, instead of the mean.

## Version 1.0.7 (9/3/2021)

Added the functions plot_training_data() and plot_moran_training_data() to help explore the training data prior to modeling.

Also fixed an issue where response variables could be identified as binary by mistake.

## Version 1.0.6 (9/3/2021)

A bug regarding the predictions generated by `rf()` that affected every other function fitting models has been fixed. Previously, the model predictions came from the "predictions" slot produced by `ranger()`. Such predictions are produced from the out-of-bag data during model training, and are different and lead to lower R squared values than those produced with predict(). Now the predictions yielded by rf() are generated with predict(), and therefore you might notice that now models fitted with spatialRF functions perform better than before, because they do.

The function `print_evaluation()` does not use huxtable any longer to print the evaluation results, and only shows the results of the testing model.

## Version 1.0.5 (6/3/2021)

Added support for binary data (0 and 1). The function `rf()` now tests if the data is binary, and if so, it populates the `case.weights` argument of `ranger` with the new function `case_weights()` to minimize the side effects of unbalanced data.

## Version 1.0.4 (2/3/2021)

Fixed an issue where rf() applied the wrong is.numeric check to the response variable and the predictors that caused issues with tibbles.

## Version 1.0.3 (25/2/2021)

Removed the function scale_robust() from rf(), and replaced it with scale(). It was giving more troubles than benefits.

## Version 1.0.2 (24/2/2021)

Simplified rf_spatial().

Modified rf_tuning() to better tune models fitted with rf_spatial().

Minor fixes in several other functions.

## Version 1.0.1 (22/2/2021)

All 'sf' dependencies removed from the package.

## Version 1.0.0 is ready!
