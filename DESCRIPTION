Description: Facilitates fitting spatial regression models with random forest by generating spatial predictors from a distance matrix that allow the model to learn about the spatial structure of the training data, and reduce the spatial correlation of the model residuals. The package provides three general methods to generate the spatial predictors: 'Moran's Eigenvector Maps' and 'PCA factors of the distance matrix' (Dray, Legendre, and Peres-Neto 2006 <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.02.015>), and 'distance matrix columns as explanatory variables' (Hengl et al. <doi:10.7717/peerj.5518>). The package provides tools to reduce multicollinearity, identify variable interactions, assess spatial correlation, tune random forest hyperparameters, assess model performance on spatially independent data folds, and examine the resulting models via importance plots, and response curves and surfaces. Computationally intensive functions rely on the 'ranger'  package (Wright and Ziegler 2017 <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>), and are designed to run in parallel in a single machine or a Beowulf cluster.
