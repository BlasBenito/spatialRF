\usage{
make_spatial_folds(
  data = NULL,
  dependent.variable.name = NULL,
  xy.selected = NULL,
  xy = NULL,
  distance.step.x = NULL,
  distance.step.y = NULL,
  training.fraction = 0.75,
  n.cores = parallel::detectCores() - 1,
  cluster = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with a response variable and a set of predictors. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{dependent.variable.name}{Character string with the name of the response variable. Must be in the column names of \code{data}. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{xy.selected}{Data frame with at least three columns: "x" (longitude), "y" (latitude), and "id" (integer, id of the record). Usually a subset of \code{xy}. Usually the result of applying \code{\link[=thinning]{thinning()}} or \code{\link[=thinning_til_n]{thinning_til_n()}} to 'xy' Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{xy}{data frame with at least three columns: "x" (longitude), "y" (latitude), and "id" (integer, index of the record). Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{distance.step.x}{Numeric, distance step used during the growth in the x axis of the buffers defining the training folds. Default: \code{NULL} (1/1000th the range of the x coordinates).}

\item{distance.step.y}{Numeric, distance step used during the growth in the y axis of the buffers defining the training folds. Default: \code{NULL} (1/1000th the range of the y coordinates).}

\item{training.fraction}{numeric, fraction of the data to be included in the growing buffer as training data, Default: \code{0.75}}

\item{n.cores}{Integer, number of cores to use for parallel execution. Creates a socket cluster with \code{parallel::makeCluster()}, runs operations in parallel with \code{foreach} and \verb{\%dopar\%}, and stops the cluster with \code{parallel::clusterStop()} when the job is done. Default: \code{parallel::detectCores() - 1}}

\item{cluster}{A cluster definition generated with \code{parallel::makeCluster()}. If provided, overrides \code{n.cores}. When \code{cluster = NULL} (default value), and \code{model} is provided, the cluster in \code{model}, if any, is used instead. If this cluster is \code{NULL}, then the function uses \code{n.cores} instead. The function does not stop a provided cluster, so it should be stopped with \code{parallel::stopCluster()} afterwards. The cluster definition is stored in the output list under the name "cluster" so it can be passed to other functions via the \code{model} argument, or using the \verb{\%>\%} pipe. Default: \code{NULL}}
}
\value{
A list with as many slots as rows are in \code{xy.selected}. Each slot has two slots named \code{training} and \code{testing}, with the former having the indices of the training records selected from xy, and the latter having the indices of the testing records.
}
\description{
Applies \code{\link[=make_spatial_fold]{make_spatial_fold()}} to every record in a data frame \code{xy.selected} to generate as many spatially independent folds over the dataset \code{xy} as rows are in \code{xy.selected}.
