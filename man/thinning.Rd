\title{Applies thinning to pairs of coordinates}
\usage{
thinning(xy, minimum.distance = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy}{A data frame with columns named "x" and "y" representing geographic coordinates.}

\item{minimum.distance}{Numeric, minimum distance to be set between nearby points, in the same units as the coordinates of xy.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same columns as \code{xy} with points separated by the defined minimum distance.
}
\description{
Resamples a set of points with x and y coordinates to impose a minimum distance among nearby points.
}
\details{
Generally used to remove redundant points that could produce pseudo-replication, and to limit sampling bias by disaggregating clusters of points.

 #load example data

 #thinning to points separated by 5 degrees
